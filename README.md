These files were created in Autodesk Inventor.  Files should also be openable and editable through Solidworks.  You will need to download the entire folder structure to be able to open the main assembly file correctly in either Inventor or Solidworks. 

The full assembly can be opened with the file "The Beast v1.2 PackandGo\Workspaces\Workspace\Main assembly.iam"

A "Main assembly.STEP" file has also been created for compatability.
